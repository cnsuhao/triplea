Major.Minor.Point.Micro, this is the form of a version string, such as 2.1.5.3.

Here's how I like to use versioning:

    Bump Major, if the project has been completely recreated. If not this,

    Bump Minor, if a significant new feature is added to the program, such as a sub-program(like map utilities app), a program lobby, code for TripleA map importing, etc. If not this,

    Bump Point, if a change has been made that breaks existing saves/projects/game files. If not this,

    Bump Micro, for any change at all.

Hope this helps!
