This document is a guide to how to create a map using the map creator.

1. Create a new folder that will contain all the map files. (This folder can be created wherever you want it.)

2. Create the map image using an image editor such as Windows Paint or Adobe Photoshop.
    A. Open the image editor program and create a blank image.
    B. Use the paint can or fill tool and cover the entire image with the color white.
    C. Draw all the border lines for the territories using the color black. (It must be completely black to work: #000000)
    D. Use the paint can or fill tool and fill in all the sea territories with the color blue. (You can actually use any color you want, but blue is the only one that makes sense.)
    E. Save the image you created in your map’s folder. (The one you made earlier.)

3. Create a folder named ’flags’ in your maps folder.

4. Create a folder named ’units’ in your maps folder.

5. For every player in your map that is not already included in the attached images that come with TripleA(Americans, Australians, British, Canadians, Chinese, Germans, Italians, Japanese, Neutral, Puppet_States, Russians), do this:
    A. Create a flag image for the player in png or gif format and save it in the ’flags’ folder using the player’s name as the image name.
    B. Create a folder using the player’s name as the folder name.
    C. For every unit the player has, do this:
        1. Create an image for the unit in png format and save it using the unit’s name as the file name and place it in the folder with the same name as the player.

Note: The players that are included with TripleA do not contain the images for all the different types of units. Any unit that is not included will have to be made manually. The following units are the ones already included with TripleA: aaGun, armour, artillery, battleship, battleship_hit, bomber, bomber_hb, bomber_lr, bomber_lr_hb, carrier, cruiser, destroyer, factory, factory_it, fighter, fighter_jp, fighter_lr, fighter_lr_jp, halftrack, infantry, marine, rockets, s_destroyer, submarine, submarine_ss, and transport.

6. Open part 1 of the map creator program.

7. Make sure that the instructions shown were followed and click the ’Next’ button.

8. Click the ’Browse’ button and locate the map’s folder.

9. In the ’Initial Units Scale’ textbox, enter the scaling amount used when the units are drawn in TripleA. Set this value to 1.00 if you want the units to be shown at the size they were drawn. If you want the units to be shown in TripleA smaller or larger you simply increase or decrease the number. (It has to match one of the following options: .50, .5625, .6666, .75, .8333, .875, 1.00, 1.25)

10. In the ’Map Size’ textbox, enter the size(dimensions) of the map’s image. Example: 2004,1680

11. In the ’Has Relief Tiles’ textbox, enter whether or not you have created relief tiles for the map. (A relief image is an image that is displayed over the map that makes the map look nicer. The relief tiles are the pieces of the relief image put in seperate files.)

12. In the ’Scroll Wrap’ textbox, enter whether or not you want the map to have scroll wrap enabled. Scroll wrap is used to allow the user to move to the edge of the map and continue going, resulting in one side of the map being shown next to the opposite side. Only use this if the map is complete, such as an image of the earth.

13. For every player in the map, do the following:
    A. If necessary, click the ’New Player’ button.
    B. In the ’Player Name’ textbox, enter the name of the player.
    C. Choose the color that will be shown for the player’s territories by pressing the button to the right and selecting the color using a color dialog or by entering the color you want in the ’Player Color’ textbox. (It needs to be a six digit color such as: 028805, b16708, cad82e, cfadc8, fbaa29, 9ea8b4)

14. Proceed to the next step.

Note: The following map utilities listed in this guide use command prompt windows while running. If errors occur in the utilities, the errors will be shown in those windows.
